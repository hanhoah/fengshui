5 Easy Ways to Boost the Positive Energies in Your Home Practicing feng shui
does not have to take a lot of effort. Small tweaks can have a big impact on the
energies in your home, so if you don’t have much time on your hands but want a
quick energy refresh, try these 5 simple tips! DISPLAY THINGS IN SETS OF 9
There’s nothing luckier than displaying items in sets of 9 around the home.
Doing so activates the auspicious energies of this very special number, which
brings fame, wealth, completion, success and happiness. The number 9 is also the
number of expansion, magnifying all the energies around it. Activating this
number with enhancers like the 9 Dogs to Activate Prosperity, the 9 Magnificent
Horses, and 9 Golden Taras brings this powerful number to life.You can also
bring out your collection of cures and enhancers from storage and display them
in groups of 9 to turbo-charge their potency. FRUIT BOWLS SYMBOLIZE ALL KINDS OF
GOOD THINGS! Inject good fortune vibrations into your home on a regular basis by
heading to the fruit section of your grocery store. Citrus fruits and pears are
believed to attract wealth and prosperity; grapes and pomegranates symbolize
fertility and descendants’ luck. Peaches signal youthfulness and immortality,
while apples bring peace and harmony, and all of them will boost your vitamin
C!There is no going wrong with a bowl of fruit in your kitchen, so put one
together today! If you have an aversion to real fruit, or you live in a country
where it’s just impractical to keep out a bowl of fruit at room temperature,
fake ornamental fruit work just as well! Great options here are 9 Golden Pears,
or 9 Apples. Apples are especially effective this year in 2024, with the #3
quarrelsome star dominating the chart, as apples symbolize peace and are
excellent for combating the conflict energies of the 3. FRESH PLANTS & FLOWERS
ACTIVATE GROWTH ENERGY Plants and flowers bring powerful growth energy into the
home.But they must be vibrant and healthy to supply life-enhancing chi
effectively. Groom them and care for them, and they will reward you with an
outpouring of appreciation, and GOOD LUCK! Cut flower stalks do not last as long
as potted ones, so once they start wilting, do replace them, or what was once
growth energy will turn quite quickly into decay. INCENSE CAN KEEP HARMFUL
SPIRITS AT BAY Burning incense does more than add a beautiful aroma to your
home. It purifies the energies and clears negativity. It keeps harmful spirits
out and creates a peaceful atmosphere, allowing you to de-stress and relax after
a busy day. It can also, depending on the incense blend that you choose, attract
auspicious vibrations of health, wealth, love and harmony. NOTHING LIKE HAVING
GUESTS OVER TO REVITALISE STAGNANT ENERGY The bustle of having people over fills
the home with new Yang energies. Invite close friends and family over to share a
meal; exchanging gifts at the end will boost happiness quotients as well. When
you allow good music and joyful conversations to shake up any stagnant chi, you
maximize the good fortune potential of your home and all the residents living
within it. Do this often and your home will always be brimming with lucky vibes.
